                <h1>Geode Capital</h1><h2>Terms of Use</h2>
                <p>Geode Capital Management is pleased to provide you with the products, services, content, tools, and information on this site (the Geode Site). Your use of the Geode Site is subject to the following Terms of Use ("Terms").</p>
                <p>These Terms are a binding contract between you and Geode. By using or accessing the Geode Site, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms. Your use of the Geode Site is governed by the version of the Terms in effect on the date the Geode Site is accessed by you. Geode may modify these Terms at any time and without prior notice. These Terms are in addition to any other agreements between you and Geode, including any customer or account agreements, and any other agreements that govern your use of products, services and content available on the Geode Site.</p>
                <p><strong>USE OF GEODE SITE</strong></p>
                <p>The Geode Site is intended only for your personal, non-commercial use, unless you and Geode have agreed otherwise in writing.</p>
                <p><strong>INFORMATION FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS</strong></p>
                <p>The Geode Site is intended to be made available only to customers and prospective customers residing in the United States, and the information on the Geode Site is only for such persons. Nothing on the Geode Site shall be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell a security, or any other product or service, to any person in any jurisdiction where such offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the laws of such jurisdiction.</p>
                <p><strong>NO INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATIONS OR PROFESSIONAL ADVICE</strong></p>
                <p>The Geode Site is not intended to provide tax, legal, insurance or investment advice, and nothing on the Geode Site should be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by Geode or any third party. Unless otherwise specified, you alone are solely responsible for determining whether any investment, security or strategy, or any other product or service is appropriate or suitable for you based on your investment objectives and personal and financial situation. You should consult an attorney or tax professional regarding your specific legal or tax situation.</p>
                <p><strong>COPYRIGHT POLICY, LINKING POLICY AND TRADEMARKS</strong></p>
                <p>The Geode Site is protected by applicable copyright laws. Accordingly, you may not copy, distribute, modify, post or frame-in the Geode Site, including any text, graphics, video, audio, software code, user interface design or logos. Unless you and Geode have agreed otherwise, links from another web site to the Geode Site must resolve to the top-level homepage of the Geode Site. In order to avoid confusion if you do link from another web site to the Geode Site, your web site, and the link itself, may not suggest that Geode endorses, sponsors or is affiliated with any non-Geode web site, entity, service or product, and may not make use of any Geode trademarks or service marks other than those contained within the text of the link. All trademarks and service marks on the Geode Site belong to Geode or an affiliate, except third-party trademarks and service marks, which are the property of their respective owners.</p>
                <p><strong>TIMELINESS OF CONTENT</strong></p>
                <p>All content on the Geode Site is presented only as of the date published or indicated, and may be superseded by subsequent market events or for other reasons. You are responsible for setting the cache settings on your browser to ensure you are receiving the most recent data.</p>
                <p><strong>PROHIBITED USES</strong></p>
                <p>Because all servers have limited capacity and are used by many people, do not use the Geode Site in any manner that could damage or overburden any Geode server, or any network connected to any Geode server. Do not use the Geode Site in any manner that would interfere with any other party's use of the Geode Site.</p>
                <p><strong>MEANS OF ACCESS</strong></p>
                <p>The Geode Site is generally intended to be viewed by a conventional web browser with a screen resolution of 640 by 480 pixels or greater. Although you may use other means to access the Geode Site, be aware that the Geode Site may not appear accurately through other access methods, and you use them only at your own risk. You should not access the Geode Site through devices or services that are designed to provide high-speed, automated, repeated access, unless such devices are approved or made available by Geode. Certain parts of the Geode Site may be protected by passwords or require a login. You may not obtain or attempt to obtain unauthorized access to such parts of the Geode Site, or to any other protected materials or information, through any means not intentionally made available by Geode for your specific use.</p>
                <p><strong>PASSWORD SECURITY AND NOTIFICATION</strong></p>
                <p>If you have a Personal Identification Number (PIN) for access to non-public areas of the Geode Site, you are solely responsible for all activities that occur in connection with your PIN. Accordingly, you should take steps to protect the confidentiality of your PIN. Notify Geode immediately if you become aware of any disclosure, loss, theft or unauthorized use of your PIN.</p>
                <p><strong>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</strong></p>
                <p>Geode does not make any express or implied warranties about the Geode Site or the information contained therein, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Geode does not warrant that the Geode Site will meet your needs, or that it will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free. Geode also makes no warranty that the results obtained from the use of the Geode Site or the quality of any products, services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you from or through Geode will meet your expectations.</p>
                <p><strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong></p>
                <p>Geode will not be liable to you or anyone else for any consequential, incidental, special or indirect damages (including but not limited to lost profits, trading losses or damages that result from use or loss of use). The foregoing is true even if Geode has been advised of the possibility of such damages or losses. Geode will not be liable to you or anyone else for any loss resulting from a cause over which Geode does not have direct control. This includes, without limitation, failure of electronic or mechanical equipment or communications lines (including telephone, cable and internet), unauthorized access, viruses, theft, operator errors, severe or extraordinary weather (including flood, earthquake, or other act of god), fire, war, insurrection, terrorist act, riot, labor dispute and other labor problems, accident, emergency or action of government. If you live in a state that does not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, some or all of these limitations and exclusions may not apply to you.</p>
                <p><strong>INDEMNIFICATION</strong></p>
                <p>As a condition of your use of the Geode Site, you agree to indemnify and hold Geode and its affiliates harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, liability, costs and expenses (including but not limited to attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the Geode Site, or from your violation of these Terms.</p>
                <p><strong>TERMINATION</strong></p>
                <p>Geode may terminate your access to the Geode Site for any reason, without prior notice.</p>
                <p><strong>MODIFICATION</strong></p>
                <p>Geode may modify the Geode Site for any reason, without prior notice.</p>
                <p><strong>GOVERNING LAW</strong></p>
                <p>Unless otherwise agreed, these Terms and their enforcement are governed by the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to conflicts of law, and shall inure to the benefit of Geode’s successors and assigns, whether by merger, consolidation, or otherwise.</p>
                <p><strong>SEVERABILITY</strong></p>
                <p>If a court of competent jurisdiction deems any provision of these terms unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>
                <p><strong>COMMODITY TRADING ADVISER (CTA) DISCLOSURE</strong></p>
                <p>Pursuant to an exemption from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in connection with accounts owned by qualified eligible persons, the contents of the Geode Site or any document accessible from the Geode Site are not required to be, and have not been, filed with the CFTC. The CFTC does not pass upon the merits of participating in a trading program or upon the adequacy or accuracy of commodity trading advisor disclosure. Consequently, the CFTC has not reviewed or approved any trading program referenced on the Geode Site or any related brochure or account document.</p>
